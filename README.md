# Academic Derrick â€” Minimal Theme for Jekyll

Derrick is a clean minimal and fast theme for a personal blog. See the original repo for full details.

Note: Tags for blog posts does not work on Github pages and it seems to be a pain to implement. [You can follow guides like this but I didn't bother](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20add,Ruby%20plugins%20for%20Jekyll%20site)


Homepage -> _config.yml

Other pages -> _pages/
