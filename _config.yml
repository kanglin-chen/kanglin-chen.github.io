  bio: |+
    <br />
    I am a preceptor in geospatial analysis at Harvard University's Government Department and a faculty affiliate with the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA). 
    <br />
    <br />
    I have a Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Florida, an MS in Geography (Urban and Regional Planning) from Peking University, and a Bachelor's degree in Landscape Gardening from Beijing Forestry University. 
    <br />
    I use spatial and statistical analysis, 3D geospatial modeling and visualization, data mining, and qualitative methods to conduct my research.
    <br />
    My current research focuses on integrated vulnerability analysis, combining insights from natural, built, and social environments, along with people's activity-based resilience to hazards, disturbances, and urban design integrated with Virtual Reality technologies.
    <br />
    I teach introductory and advanced GIS courses as well as GIS training programs. I also have experience in teaching quantitative methods in urban planning and R programming language.
    <br />
    I consider myself as a social-technological scholar.
