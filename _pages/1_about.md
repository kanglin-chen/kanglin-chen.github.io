I got a Ph.D. in <a href="https://dcp.ufl.edu/urp/">Urban and Regional Planning</a>, an MS in <a href="https://www.ues.pku.edu.cn/Home/Departments/Department_of_Urban_and_Regional_Planning/index.htm">Geography (Urban and Regional Planning)</a>, and a Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://en.bua.edu.cn/info/1129/1472.htm">Landscape Gardening</a>. 
<br />

My research interests include GIScience, travel behavior, the built enviornment, vulnerability and resilience, and hazards. 
<br />

My primary research methods include spatial and statistical analysis, 3D geospatial techniques, and data mining. I am proficient in GIS software, R, and Python. I also have training in qualitative methods and urban and landscape design.
<br />

I have participated in environment-related research and practical projects in both the U.S. and China. 
<br />

I consider myself as an urban planner, a geographer, and a social-technological scholar.
