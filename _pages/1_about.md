<br />

My research interests include GIScience, travel behavior, the built enviornment, vulnerability and resilience, and hazards. My work covers transportation planning and environmental planning.
<br />

My primary research methods include spatial and statistical analysis, 3D geospatial techniques, and data mining. I am proficient in GIS software, Python, and R. I also have training in qualitative methods as well as urban and landscape design.
<br />

I have participated in environment-related research and practical projects in both the U.S. and China. 
<br />

I consider myself as an urban planner, a geographer, and a social-technological scholar.
