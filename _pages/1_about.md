<br />

My research interests include spatial science, urban planning, travel behavior, hazards & resilience, and public health.

My primary research methods include spatial analysis, big data analytics, spatial statistics, statistical analysis, and 3D geospatial techniques. I am proficient in GIS software, Python, and R. I also have training in data mining, qualitative methods, community-based planning, and urban and landscape design.

I have participated in environment-related research and practical projects in both the U.S. and China.
