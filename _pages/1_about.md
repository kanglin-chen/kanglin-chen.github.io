I got a Ph.D. in <a href="https://dcp.ufl.edu/urp/">Urban and Regional Planning</a> from the University of Florida, an MS in <a href="https://www.ues.pku.edu.cn/Home/Departments/Department_of_Urban_and_Regional_Planning/index.htm">Geography</a> from Peking University, and a <a href="https://sola.bjfu.edu.cn/">B.Agric.</a> from BJFU.
<br />

My research focuses on spatial science and urban planning, with topics including hazard management and resilience, human mobility and transportation planning, and the built environment. 
<br />

My research methods include spatial analysis, big data analytics, spatial statistics, remote sensing, and data mining. I am proficient in GIS software, Python, and R. I also have training in 3D geospatial techniques integrated with VR, qualitative methods and community-based approaches, and urban and landscape design.
<br />

Beyond research, I have participated in practical planning and tool‚Äêdevelopment projects in environmental and transportation fields, collaborating with government agencies in both the U.S. and China.
<br />

I consider myself as a spatial scientist and urban planner.
