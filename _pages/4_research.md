I am broadly interested in developing statistical tools for applications relevant to public policy and public health.
More specifically I'm interested in:

* Official Statistics
* Small Area Estimation
* Analysis of Complex Surveys
* Markov Random Field Models (spatial & temporal)
* Bayesian Methods

I am co-advised by [Zehang Li](https://zehangli.com) and [Paul Parker](https://www.paparkerstat.com).
