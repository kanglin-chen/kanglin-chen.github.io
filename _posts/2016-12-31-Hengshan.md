This project involves the development of the Master Plan (2001-2030, 2016 revision) for Mount Heng (Hengshan) National Park in China (北岳恒山风景名胜区). The plan encompasses residential planning within the protection area and buffer zones of the national park, ecological conservation, tourism planning, infrastructure and facility construction, design of visiting routes, visitor management, and coordination with other planning efforts and regulations. 

The plans are currently in use by Shanxi Province (山西省) in China.
