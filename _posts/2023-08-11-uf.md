After the disruption caused by COVID-19 on travel worldwide, American travel trends stepped into a relative stabilization since around March 2021. The US government is actively releasing funding for COVID-19 long-term recovery and infrastructure development. However, there is limited understanding of the stabilized travel trends among Americans and how travel behavior varies across communities under different environment features.

In this context, this dissertation investigates Americansâ€™ multi-dimensional travel changes and adapted travel following COVID-19 during the relatively stabilized adapted travel period, as well as the associations between these adapted travel dimensions and social vulnerability and built environment factors.
