After the disruption caused by COVID-19 on travel worldwide, American travel trends stepped into a relative stabilization since around March 2021. The US government is actively releasing funding for COVID-19 long-term recovery and infrastructure development. However, there is limited understanding of the adapted travel trends among Americans and how travel behavior varies across communities with different environmental features. 

This dissertation investigates the changes in Americans' travel patterns and the adaptations in multiple dimensions following COVID-19. It also examines the associations between these adapted travel behaviors and 23 social vulnerability factors as well as 19 built environment factors, based on spatial regression and correlation analyses.
