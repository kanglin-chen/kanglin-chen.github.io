Signal4 Analytics is an interactive, web-based system designed to enhance traffic information sharing in the state of Florida. It supports crash visualization, mapping, and analysis for transportation planning agencies, law enforcement, traffic engineers, and research institutions. The systemâ€™s geospatial analysis of crash data informs safety decision-making and facilitates evidence-based transportation planning.

The data used to generate geospatial results in the Signal4 system includes over 4 million crash records provided by DHSMV, over 4 million citations, Florida Unified GIS Streets, and local traffic volumes (where available). Signal4 Analytics also maintains the publicly available [Florida Traffic Safety Dashboard](https://signal4analytics.com/), which provides crash data across Florida.
